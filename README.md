# ZeroGravitas' SWTOR Tools.

### WARNING: this Add-on is Blender 3.6.12 / 4.0.x-compatible, but some of its tools depend on having installed a 4.0-compatible .gr2 Importer Add-on in turn (there is a beta of such available [here](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Granny2-Plug-In-Blender-2.8x/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha).

**Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/ZG-SWTOR-Tools/releases/latest)**.

**This Blender Add-on provides with a miscellanea of tools to import, assemble, texture and improve upon Star Wars: The Old Republic's game assets. It grows in features as new ideas come up. Quality of code-wise, "this is not a place of honor": It Just (Kinda) Works™.**

**This Add-on relies on foundational efforts by fellow slicers, such as the [.gr2 Importer Addon](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/ZG-SWTOR-https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Granny2-Plug-In-Blender-2.8x), which works under the hood in places, and the [Slicers GUI Tool](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/ZG-SWTOR-https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Slicers-GUI), which allows for extracting the game assets we play with, plus game information exported by tools in [Jedipedia.net](https://https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en) and [TORCommunity.com](https://torcommunity.com/).** It should be pointed out that the .gr2 Importer Add-on is receiving some major features (including preferences settings) that interact with the ZG SWTOR Tools.


**The [ZG SWTOR Tools' pages in our Wiki](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/ZG-SWTOR-Tools-Add-on) are yet to be updated.** Everything has extensive tooltips, though.
