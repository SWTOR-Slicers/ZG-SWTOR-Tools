# ZeroGravitas' SWTOR Tools.

**This Blender Add-on provides with a miscellanea of tools to use on Star Wars: The Old Republic's game assets, including a Materials Processor to auto-texture models. It grows in features as new ideas come up. Quality of code-wise, "this is not a place of honor": It Just (Kinda) Worksâ„¢.**

**(This Add-on relies on the efforts of fellow slicers, such as the [.gr2 Importer Addon](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Granny2-Plug-In-Blender-2.8x), which provides some major functionality in places, and [Slicers GUI Tool](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Slicers-GUI))**

**Check the [ZG SWTOR Tools Wiki](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/ZG-SWTOR-Tools/wiki)  for installation instructions and each tool's user guide.**
