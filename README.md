# ZeroGravitas' SWTOR Tools.

* ### Requires downloading the [latest .gr2 Importer Add-on](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Granny2-Plug-In-Blender-2.8x/releases/latest).
* ### Now compatible with Blender 4.3 and higher.  
* ### NPC import including Creature-type ones works far better now.
* ### Compatible with Game Update 7.6 and higher's Modernized PC/NPC skin textures. 

  Depending on which resources folder is selected in the add-on's Preferences (extracted before or after Game Update 7.6), the tool gets the correct classic or modernized results. Check the Character Assembler tool's guide for details.

**This Blender Add-on provides with a miscellanea of tools to import, assemble, texture and improve upon Star Wars: The Old Republic's game assets. It grows in features as new ideas come up. Quality of code-wise, "this is not a place of honor": It Just (Kinda) Worksâ„¢.**

This Add-on relies on foundational efforts by fellow slicers, such as the **[.gr2 Importer Addon](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/ZG-SWTOR-https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Granny2-Plug-In-Blender-2.8x)**, which is invoked under the hood in places, and the **[ExtracTOR](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/Installing-Slicers-GUI-and-extracting-SWTOR-game-assets)**, **[Slicers GUI](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/ZG-SWTOR-https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Slicers-GUI)**, and even ancient **TorMYP/EasyMYP** tools, which allow for extracting the game assets we play with in, to start with, plus game information exported by tools in **[Jedipedia.net](https://https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en)** and **[TORCommunity.com](https://torcommunity.com/)**.

## Recent changes:
2025-04
* Tentative support for Blender 4.3 and 4.4.
* New Named Materials Processor tool in the Shader Editor.
* Revised, simplified EmissiveOnly material.
* Attempt at substituting unsupported SWTOR shaders with their closest supported ones. Might backfire. To check a material's original shader, check Blender's Material Inspector's Custom Properties subpanel.

2025-02

* Support for SWTOR Game Update 7.6's modernized skin materials.
* Support for the improvements in the .gr2 Add-on's NPC support.
* Bug corrections in the Objects/Skeletons/Materials' names prefixer and Merge Physics tools.

2024-09

* Minor corrections in the Merge Doubles (Edit Mode) tool for compatibility with Blender 4.1 and higher.


2024-07:

* Compatibility with Blender 4.0.x (depends on the .gr2 Importer Add-on's own compatibility).
* The Add-on interacts with the .gr2 Importer Add-on's new features, exposing some of them in the Status Panel. Several Objects Tools use them (see Object Tools page's prologue).
* Area Assembler:
  * Corrects a bug in its instancer code (responsible for duplicating already imported objects to speed up assembling): now **more objects ought to land in their correct places** instead of ending up floating around at random.
  * **Terrains no longer show fissures thanks to an improved SWTOR Terrain Extractor. please download it and regenerate your terrains with it**.
  * **NEW: It assembles 64-bit SpeedTrees** now, filling a Tython or a Dromund Kaas with trees.
  * **Makes sure whole imported areas are consistently placed relative to the scene's origin**. In theory, merging partial Area Assemblies into a final scene wwith everything fitting correctly ought to be possible.
* Group Areas in Subcollections: works far better and easier now.
* Character Assembler (in combination with improvements in the .gr2 Importer Add-on):
  * Solves an issue with NPCs' skin areas showing armor material instead of skin.
  * **NEW: it pplies DirectionMaps to hair and fur**.
  * Corrects an issue with Twi'lek eyes' UVs that kept them from baking correctly.
  * **NEW: it can separate the eyes into a different object**, which some third party rigging systems prefer.
  * **NEW: it can make each eye a separate object**, adjusting their origins so that we can control them with both bones and conventional rotations at once.
* **NEW: Merge Physics Bones' Vertex Groups**: helps with Cloth Physics applications.
* **NEW: Set Objects' Properties Manually**: for management of .gr2 object properties (nothing to see here, move along).
* **NEW: Clear bone Translations**: to solve imported animations and poses' distorted limbs.
* **NEW: Correct Twi'lek eyes' UVs.**: same as in the Character Assembler, but applicable to already imported models.
